LEARNING DIARY, MOBILE DEVELOPMENT MODULE

16.10.2023
Started working on the course,
I had some difficulties setting up Android Studio,
because the video is old and the app doesn't look the same as in the video.
I also made the git repository which took a while because I'm quite rusty with using git,
but I figured it out in the end after some googling
I worked through the video in Part 1 and learned all the goals of it.
It was quite simple, and I'm exited to work on a more complex app!
I might switch over this diary to Word,
so that I can add pictures and make the diary more interesting,
a txt file is pretty boring.

I completed part 2 with some difficulties opening up google,
seems my emulator doesn't have a web browser installed that can resolve the intent...
Other than that, this part went pretty smoothly and I understand now how to open new activities.
I'm also learning quite a bit about android studio and how to use it efficiently.
