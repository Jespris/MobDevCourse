# MobDevCourse

This github repository is my progress following the online course about Android Mobile Development. This course was completed in October 2023 by me Jesper Andersson.
There is a course diary in the repository which explains my progress and difficulties during this course.

The project should work just by importing the entire repository into Android Studio and running the main activity with an Android device of your choice.
